## Preparation for computer exercises

- Try using Google Colab ([https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)) before the exercises if you have not used it before.

Following (optional) pre-course learning tasks will help you to understand computer exercises better:

- If you are new to Python programming language, consider learning the basics.
    - [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- If you are new to NumPy, consider learning the basics:
    - [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/) [See Numpy Arrays under Data Science tutorials]

#### Challenge 1: Train an agent that plays Toribash
- Toribash is a 1v1 fighting game.
- Design and/or train an agent for Toribash-DestroyUke-v1 task: The higher cumulative reward at the end of the game/episode, the better. Find the environment from Github link below.
- Ready made learning environment (ToriLLE) can be found from this link:
[https://github.com/Miffyli/ToriLLE](https://github.com/Miffyli/ToriLLE)
- Information about ToriLLE can be found from our paper
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10110](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10110)

#### Challenge 2: Imitating a celebrity voice
- Use the corpus VoxCeleb ([http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/))
- It contains a very large number (> 1000) of celebrity voices. Find closest to
your voice using speaker recognition technology.
- Try to see if you can get better score by modifying your voice.
- Get the project package including pre-trained speaker recognition models from [here](http://cs.uef.fi/~vvestman/files/celeb_match_project.zip).

#### Challenge 3: Test the impact of environmental noise in a Speaker Recognition System (SRS)
- Modify a set of speech signals from Voxceleb by adding noise and test the performance of the SRS (Use the SRS from the practice)
- Apply a speech enhancement method and recheck the system performance (e.g. Wiener filter in Scipy)
- Challenge the system with a different issue and compare results (e.g. short duration)
- Record your own voice and repeat the process. Compare the obtained results with the one with the previous set of signals and discuss.
- Get the project package including pre-trained speaker recognition models from [here](http://cs.uef.fi/~vvestman/files/challenge3.zip). -->
